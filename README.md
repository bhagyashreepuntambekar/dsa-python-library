# DSA Python Library

A personal library of **custom data structures and algorithms** implemented in **Python** for learning, practice, and portfolio purposes.

This library covers core **data structures** and **algorithms**, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and sorting algorithms. Each module is accompanied by **unit tests** to ensure correctness.

## Features

- **Arrays**: Dynamic array with resizing  
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists  
- **Stacks & Queues**: Array-based and linked-list-based  
- **Hash Tables**: Separate chaining implementation  
- **Trees**: Binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree 
- **Heaps**: MinHeap and MaxHeap  
- **Sorting Algorithms**: QuickSort, MergeSort, RadixSort  
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra  
- **Unit Tests**: Each structure and algorithm includes test cases
